# Google Sans Flex Font Files

Place your Google Sans Flex font files in this directory:

- `GoogleSansFlex-Regular.woff2` (weight: 400)
- `GoogleSansFlex-Medium.woff2` (weight: 500)
- `GoogleSansFlex-Bold.woff2` (weight: 700)

The font is configured in `app/layout.tsx` to use these files.

**Note:** Google Sans Flex is a proprietary font. You'll need to obtain the font files and place them in this directory for the font to work.
